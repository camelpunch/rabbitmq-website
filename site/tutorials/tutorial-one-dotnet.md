# RabbitMQ tutorial - "Hello World!" SUPPRESS-RHS

## Introduction

## "Hello World"
### (using the .NET/C# Client)

In this part of the tutorial we'll write two programs in C#; a
producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives
messages and prints them out.  We'll gloss over some of the detail in
the .NET API, concentrating on this very simple thing just to get
started.  It's a "Hello World" of messaging.

In the diagram below, "P" is our producer and "C" is our consumer. The
box in the middle is a queue - a message buffer that RabbitMQ keeps
on behalf of the consumer.

> #### The .NET client library
>
> RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open,
> general-purpose protocol for messaging. There are a number of clients
> for RabbitMQ in [many different
> languages](http://rabbitmq.com/devtools.html). We'll
> use the .NET client provided by RabbitMQ.
>
> Download the [client library
> package](http://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet.html), and check its
> signature as described. Extract it and copy "RabbitMQ.Client.dll" to your working folder.
>
> You also need to ensure your system can find the C# compiler `csc.exe`,
> you may need to add `;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5` (change .NET version
> to fit your installation) to your Path.

Now we have the .NET client binary, we can write some
code.

### Sending

<div class="diagram">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/sending.png" alt="(P) -> [|||]" height="100" />
</div>

We'll call our message sender `Send` and our message receiver
`Receive.cs`.  The sender will connect to RabbitMQ, send a single message,
then exit.

In
[`Send.cs`](http://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/dotnet/Send.cs),
we need to use some namespaces:

    :::csharp
    using System;
    using RabbitMQ.Client;
    using System.Text;

Set up the class:

    :::csharp
    class Send
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            ...
        }
    }

then we can create a connection to the server:

    :::csharp
    class Send
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
            using (var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
            {
                using (var channel = connection.CreateModel())
                {
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }

The connection abstracts the socket connection, and takes care of
protocol version negotiation and authentication and so on for us. Here
we connect to a broker on the local machine - hence the
_localhost_. If we wanted to connect to a broker on a different
machine we'd simply specify its name or IP address here.

Next we create a channel, which is where most of the API for getting
things done resides.

To send, we must declare a queue for us to send to; then we can publish a message
to the queue:

    :::csharp
    using System;
    using RabbitMQ.Client;
    using System.Text;
    
    class Send
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
            using(var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
            using(var channel = connection.CreateModel())
            {
                channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "hello",
                                     durable: false,
                                     exclusive: false,
                                     autoDelete: false,
                                     arguments: null);
    
                string message = "Hello World!";
                var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
    
                channel.BasicPublish(exchange: "",
                                     routingKey: "hello",
                                     basicProperties: null,
                                     body: body);
                Console.WriteLine(" [x] Sent {0}", message);
            }
    
            Console.WriteLine(" Press [enter] to exit.");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }


Declaring a queue is idempotent - it will only be created if it doesn't
exist already. The message content is a byte array, so you can encode
whatever you like there.

When the code above finishes running, the channel and the connection
will be disposed.

[Here's the whole Send.cs
class](http://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/dotnet/Send.cs).

### Receiving

That's it for our sender.  Our receiver is pushed messages from
RabbitMQ, so unlike the sender which publishes a single message, we'll
keep it running to listen for messages and print them out.

<div class="diagram">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/receiving.png" alt="[|||] -> (C)" height="100" />
</div>

The code (in [`Receive.cs`](http://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/dotnet/Receive.cs)) has almost the same `using` statements as `Send`:

    :::csharp
    using RabbitMQ.Client;
    using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;
    using System;
    using System.Text;


Setting up is the same as the sender; we open a connection and a
channel, and declare the queue from which we're going to consume.
Note this matches up with the queue that `send` publishes to.

    :::csharp
    class Receive
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
            using (var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
            {
                using (var channel = connection.CreateModel())
                {
                    channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "hello",
                                         durable: false,
                                         exclusive: false,
                                         autoDelete: false,
                                         arguments: null);
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }

Note that we declare the queue here, as well. Because we might start
the receiver before the sender, we want to make sure the queue exists
before we try to consume messages from it.

We're about to tell the server to deliver us the messages from the
queue. Since it will push us messages asynchronously, we provide a
callback. That is what `EventingBasicConsumer.Received` event handler
does.

    :::csharp
    using RabbitMQ.Client;
    using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;
    using System;
    using System.Text;
    
    class Receive
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
            using(var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
            using(var channel = connection.CreateModel())
            {
                channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "hello",
                                     durable: false,
                                     exclusive: false,
                                     autoDelete: false,
                                     arguments: null);
    
                var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);
                consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
                {
                    var body = ea.Body;
                    var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(body);
                    Console.WriteLine(" [x] Received {0}", message);
                };
                channel.BasicConsume(queue: "hello",
                                     noAck: true,
                                     consumer: consumer);
    
                Console.WriteLine(" Press [enter] to exit.");
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }


[Here's the whole Receive.cs
class](http://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/dotnet/Receive.cs).

### Putting It All Together

You can compile both of these by referencing the RabbitMQ .NET client
assembly. We're using the command line (`cmd.exe` and `csc`) to
compile and run the code. Alternatively you could use Visual Studio.

    :::bash
    $ csc /r:"RabbitMQ.Client.dll" Send.cs
    $ csc /r:"RabbitMQ.Client.dll" Receive.cs

Then run the executable

    :::bash
    $ Send.exe

then, run the receiver:

    :::bash
    $ Receive.exe

The receiver will print the message it gets from the sender via
RabbitMQ. The receiver will keep running, waiting for messages (Use Ctrl-C to stop it), so try running
the sender from another terminal.

If you want to check on the queue, try using `rabbitmqctl list_queues`.

Hello World!

Time to move on to [part 2](tutorial-two-dotnet.html) and build a simple _work queue_.
